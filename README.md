Let Africa Build (LAB) is Africa’s first Bitcoin development hub and incubator. We train and support the next generation of African developers and technical founders in Bitcoin fundamentals, Lightning infrastructure, and open-source collaboration. Through structured programs, mentorship, and hands-on experience across the Bitcoin ecosystem, including Layer 2 solutions such as Stacks, we prepare new builders to develop infrastructure that positions Africa to participate meaningfully in the global digital economy while creating scalable economic solutions across the continent.

LAB operates through a hybrid model combining structured technical education, contributor sprints, incubation, and Regional Bitcoin Labs.

## Origin & Evolution
LAB evolved from Stacks Labs, a community-led developer onboarding initiative focused on Bitcoin Layer 2 development.

**Our pilot model** <br>
• Onboarded and trained 300+ developers across Africa and Australia <br>
• Operated structured workshops and bootcamps <br>
• Executed milestone-based grant programs <br>
• Built partnerships with universities, communities, and ecosystem actors <br>

The operational framework, curriculum, and community model developed under Stacks Labs were formalized and expanded into LAB to build a scalable, measurable Bitcoin contributor pipeline.

## Proof of Work
Through our precursor, we demonstrated: <br>

• 300+ developers onboarded and trained both within and outside the ecosystem (Stacks Nigeria) <br>
•  N128m raised during the pilot builders cohort <br>
•  Ability to create a developer-focused community <br>
•  Potential to scale with minimum support from the [community awarded grant](https://github.com/stacksgov/decentralized-grants/issues/10) <br>
• Structured workshops, meetups, and bootcamps <br>
• Verifiable PoW that helped LAB secure a $70,000 milestone-based grant [Stacks SIP-31 Interim Grant](https://github.com/stacksgov/sip31-interim-grants/issues/17) <br>
• Published curriculum framework <br>
• Operational LMS infrastructure <br>
• Institutional partnerships across universities, youth organizations, and ecosystem actors <br>

## Program Model

**LAB operates a structured cohort cycle:**<br>
- Technical Onboarding & Screening <br>
- 6-Month Bitcoin Bootcamp<br>
- Contributor Sprint & Infrastructure Incubation<br>
- National Bitcoin-Focused Hackathon<br>
- Performance-Based Contributor Fellowship<br>

## Regional Bitcoin Labs<br>
- LAB activates phased Regional Bitcoin Labs to support:<br>
- Bitcoin node experimentation<br>
- Lightning testing environments<br>
- Infrastructure refinement<br>
- Contributor sprint collaboration<br>
- Periodic workshops and technical meetups<br>

These labs support measurable open-source engagement during the cohort cycle.

## Founder
Dr. Eniola Samuel is the founder of Let Africa Build and previously led Stacks Africa initiatives.

He created one of the first community-recognized developer onboarding initiatives within the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem in Africa, building partnerships with universities, community organizations, and public institutions to expand developer participation in Bitcoin infrastructure.

Through Stacks Labs and now LAB, he has focused on building structured, measurable technical education pathways designed to increase Africa’s participation in global Bitcoin infrastructure development.

## Mission
To strengthen Africa’s participation in global Bitcoin infrastructure by building technically capable developers, contributors, and infrastructure-focused teams.
